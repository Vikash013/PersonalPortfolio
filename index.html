            Greetings! My name is Vikash and my journey into the world of
            software development began in August 2022. It began when my
            curiosity was peaked by engaging videos, insightful articles and
            inspiring discussions with both my peers and former Computer Science
            teacher.

            Ever since, I have been self-learning programming using things like
            tutorials, sites - like freeCodeCamp - as well as building projects
            to help contintually expand my knowledge and ability as a software
            developer.

            <h3>DC TopTrumps Replica</h3>
            <p>
              Utilised Java and NetBeans IDE in conjunction with waterfall
              development to create a superhero-themed TopTrumps game. Analysed,
              designed, implemented and tested/evaluated the success of the
              programming project in documentation which achieved 90% of marks
              and resulted in a playable game with a GUI (designed using Java
              Swing).

            <br />
            <p>
              As this was a coursework project for my A-Level Computer Science
              course I no longer have access to the source code but do have the
              documentation which contains snippets of it:

            <h3>Microsoft Rewards Point Automater</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a Java-based application to automate Microsoft Reward
              tasks which includes a user-friendly GUI for ease of use.
              Generates search results for 30 randomly selected words (from a
              text file of every word in the English Language) in Microsoft Edge
              which allows users to earn 90 points per day through automated
              searches, saving time and effort.

            <h3>Luxury Camp Site Management System</h3>
            <p>
              Used Java with JavaFX to build a multi-featured application for a
              degree-level assignment which is nearly 800 lines of code long.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Allows the user (i.e. the owner) to switch between four different
              areas of the site, check customers in/out and update a table to
              show which rooms are occupied, available and need cleaning. It
              also validates rooms to meet certain requirements before customers
              can be checked into them.

            <h3>Call of Duty Camo Tracker</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently engrossed in the development of a website utilising
              web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.). This
              endeavor seeks to establish an user-friendly solution for tracking
              the overall completion of Call of Duty camos.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The inspiration behind this website stems from the notoriously
              complex and difficult to use in-game UI with addition of the
              tedious task of monitoring camo completion status. By designing a
              user-friendly interface, this platform aims to streamline the way
              camo progress is tracked.
