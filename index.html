            Hello! My name is Vikash, and my journey into the world of software
            development began in August 2022. From engaging videos to insightful
            articles and inspiring discussions with peers and mentors, I
            discovered my passion for coding and problem-solving.

            I have embarked on a self-learning journey, using resources like
            tutorials and platforms such as freeCodeCamp. Through this process,
            I've built various projects that continuously expand my knowledge
            and skills as a software developer.

            <p>
              Utilised Java and NetBeans IDE in conjunction with waterfall
              development to create a superhero-themed TopTrumps game. Analysed,
              designed, implemented and tested/evaluated the success of the
              programming project in documentation which achieved 90% of marks
              and resulted in a playable game with a GUI (designed using Java
              Swing).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As this was a coursework project for my A-Level Computer Science
              course, I no longer have access to the source code but do have the
              documentation which contains snippets of it.

            <h3>Microsoft Rewards Point Automater</h3>
            <p>
              Developed a Java-based application to automate Microsoft Reward

              It functions by generating search results for 30 randomly selected
              words, by reading a text file of every word in the English
              Language, in Microsoft Edge. This then allows users to earn 90
              points per day through automated searches which saves time and
              effort.

              Allows the user (i.e. the owner) to switch between four different
              areas of the site, check customers in/out and update a table to
              show which rooms are occupied, available and need cleaning. It
              also validates rooms to meet certain requirements before customers
              can be checked into them.

            <h3>Call of Duty Camo Tracker</h3>
            <p>
              I am currently engrossed in the development of a website utilising
              web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.) which
              seeks to establish a user-friendly solution for tracking the
              overall completion of Call of Duty camos.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The inspiration behind this website stems from the notoriously
              complex and cluttered UI of the game itself which thus causes the
              task of monitoring camo completion status to be even more
              complicated. For context, camos in Call of Duty are awarded when a
              player completes a challenge with a specific weapon e.g. to get 50
              headshots with that weapon.
