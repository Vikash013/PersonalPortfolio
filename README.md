# Portfolio Website

A website I constructed using HTML, CSS and some JS to give readers an introduction to myself, how I got started into software development as well as display projects I have made.

Includes links to my LinkedIn, GitHub and to view my CV. Also has a contact form which can be used to send email messages to me, say hello!
